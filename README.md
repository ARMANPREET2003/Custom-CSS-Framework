# Custom-CSS-Framework

Custom-Css-Framework is a customizable, lightweight and easy to implement framework that we had built with SAAS. This custom CSS framework provides a theme for standard HTML elements, such as headings, lists, buttons, forms, inputs, and tables. It also includes utility classes for common styling like color, font weight, margin, padding, and borders. The framework is built using Sass and is fully customizable via Sass variables.
